# This is a simple laravel ToDo App made with the intention of implementing CRUD in laravel.
# To use the app create a database and name it ToDo. 
# Clone the app and edit the .env file in the DB_PASSWORD field to your localhost password.
# Thats pretty much all you need to get going.
# The ToDo APP works on basis of adding a  new goal and its checklist.
# By default the goal starts immediately you register it.
# You can mark a goal as accomplished and give it a score and remarks for future reference.
# This is a simple CRUD in laravel illustration. I hope it inspires you.
